# Portfolio Website

URL: https://www.bryanjguilas.com/

My goal for this project was to create my personal portfolio using nothing but HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (No framework). I felt like doing so would help me understand the core concepts of web development much better which would set me up with better knowledge of the fundamentals when I jumped into a framework like React. This project was a tremendous help in my development as a programmer. I am extremely proud of this website! It is a great reminded of how much Iâ€™ve actually learned in the past year.
