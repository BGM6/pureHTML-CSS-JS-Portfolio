# Portfolio Website

My goal for this project was to create my personal portfolio using just HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (No frameworks). I felt like doing so would help me understand the core concept of web development therefore setting me up with better fundemental knowldge when I jumped into a framework like React.
